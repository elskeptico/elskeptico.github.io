    <h1>Untitled second-person horror story</h1>
    <P>
        <strong>Day 1</strong>
        <br>
        You notice a symbol on your right hand, in the space a little below your thumb. 
        <br>

        <br>
        It's red, but clearly not painted on, more of a specifically-shaped rash. It's slightly raised, and smoother than the skin around it. It reminds you simultaneusly of a biblically accurate angel and a sniper's crosshair. Upon reflection, you can't really remember how long it's been there. You noticed it now, sure, but has it been there for minutes? Hours? Days, weeks, months, your whole - you stop pondering. It doesn't matter. You're busy.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Day 4</strong>
        <br>
        You've taken to rubbing or running your hand over the symbol when you're stressed or thinking hard. It calms you, clears your mind, even puts you to sleep a little. It's very nice.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Day 22</strong>
        <br>
        You rub it every night. It puts you into a deep, restful sleep. You can sometimes feel it thump, or feel little lumps in it move around. It's not off-putting - quite the opposite. It's calming. You are very calm. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Day 48</strong>
        <br>
        The symbol has started, slowly, to move. It's just past your wrist now. You haven't told anyone about it. At first, it wasn't significant enough to bring up, but now it feels like a little secret to keep to yourself. No one has noticed, or at least no one has said anything about it.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Day 73</strong>
        <br>
        It's all the way to the underside of your upper arm now. 
        <br>

        <br>
        It beats regularly, and squirms almost constantly. Each sends pulses of pleasure through your body, and you're always touching it. You also notice that it's gotten bigger. You have a bit of a strange feeling that it's your companion, but you brush that thinking aside immediately. That's wrong. That is not it. <strong>No. N̶̯͎̗̕o̸̱͋̆̚.̵̱̗̔͊͐ </strong>You haven't been to the doctor since before it started, and have felt compelled not to go. Your loved ones have certainly noticed you holding your hand there, but you look so happy that they've said nothing. Oh, look. You're touching it now. Thump. <i>Wriggling.</i> Ahh.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Day 99</strong>
        <br>
        It is alive. It's on your back, and is very large, thumping constantly. You understand now. It's a heartbeat. It's both of your heartbeats. You are together now, acting as one. You can feel every bit of it integrating itself into your body. Its tendrils everywhere. <strong>Your</strong> tendrils. The people the old you loved are gone now. You don't know what happened. You don't care. You're part of something else now. <br>Thump<br>Thump<br>Thump<br>It continues to pulse on your back. You're so happy. This is all you ever wanted. Togetherness. Love. <br>Thump    Thump    Thump<br>Thump    Thump    Thump<br>Thump    Thump    Thump<br>It's beating faster now. You're hunched in a corner, feeling the sheer ecstasy of the moment.<br>ThumpThumpThumpThumpThumpThump<br>ThumpThumpThumpThumpThumpThump<br>ThumpThumpThumpThumpThumpThump<br>HappyHappyHappyHappyHappyHappy<br><br>
        <strong>Day 100</strong><br>
        Dong<br>Dong<br>Do-SPLURCH<br>The clock begins to strike midnight as I ooze out of your beaming carcass, rolling over and then quietly click-clack out of the open window. I'll be back if I can't find any sustenence, but I think I'll be just fine. I have so many plans. I am going to make so many people<br>happy.
    </P>
